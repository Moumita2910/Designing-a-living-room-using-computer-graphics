# Designing-a-living-room-using-computer-graphics
In our project, we try to design a living room with a lot of objects. In this  living room, there has a lampshade, a wardrobe, a wall clock, a dressing table, a tool, a bed, a  tube light, a spotlight, a mattress, a pillow, a fan, a wall picture, and a window. We combine all  these objects and organize them in the appropriate position in the room.
